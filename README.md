# Basic Jest Demo App

This is a basic demo app to show how to use Jest for testing React Native apps with Expo.

## Setup

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `yarn install` to install dependencies
3. Run `yarn expo start` to start the Expo server
4. Run `yarn test` to run tests

## Notes

- The tests are located in `tests` folder
- Each branch named `level/*` (where * is any number, like one, two, or three), contains incremental changes to the test case to understand better
- The tests are named `*.test.js` so that Jest can find them
- This repo is mainly meant for Orbital Students under author [@juliussneezer04](https://github.com/juliussneezer04)
